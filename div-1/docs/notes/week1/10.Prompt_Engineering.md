# Day 3: Prompt Engineering - The Art of Instruction

> **The 80/20 Takeaway:** Don't just ask. **Guide.** Use **Few-Shot** (give examples) for style, and **Chain of Thought** (ask for reasoning) for logic. These two tricks solve 90% of "bad output" problems.

## 1. The Core Mental Model: "The Intern"

Treat the LLM like a smart but clueless intern.
*   **Bad Prompt:** "Write a marketing email." (Intern: "About what? For whom? What tone?")
*   **Good Prompt:** "Write a marketing email for [Product], targeting [Audience]. Use a [Tone] tone. Here are 3 examples of our previous emails..."

## 2. The Techniques (Zero vs. Few vs. CoT)

### A. Zero-Shot (The "Hail Mary")
*   **What:** Asking without examples.
*   **Use for:** General knowledge ("What is the capital of France?").
*   **Risk:** High chance of generic or wrong style.

### B. Few-Shot (The "Monkey See, Monkey Do")
*   **What:** Giving 2-3 examples of Input -> Output.
*   **Use for:** Formatting, Style, Tone.
*   **Example:**
    > User: Convert to JSON.
    > Input: "John is 25." -> Output: `{"name": "John", "age": 25}`
    > Input: "Sarah is 30." -> Output: `{"name": "Sarah", "age": 30}`
    > Input: "Mike is 40." -> Output: ...

### C. Chain of Thought (CoT) (The "Show Your Work")
*   **What:** Asking the model to "Think step by step".
*   **Use for:** Math, Logic, Coding.
*   **Why:** It forces the model to generate more tokens (reasoning) before committing to an answer, reducing hallucinations.

## 3. The Framework: OCEAN

A simple checklist for every prompt:
1.  **O**bjective: What do you want? ("Summarize this email")
2.  **C**ontext: Who are you? Who is the audience? ("I am a busy CEO, audience is my team")
3.  **E**xamples: (Few-Shot)
4.  **A**ssess: (Not in prompt, but check the output)
5.  **N**egotiate: (Iterate if wrong)

## 4. Summary for D.I.V.A

*   **System Prompt:** This is the "God Prompt" that sets the rules. "You are D.I.V.A, a helpful assistant..."
*   **Orchestrator:** Use **Few-Shot** to teach it how to call tools (JSON format).
*   **Logic:** Use **CoT** ("Let's think step by step") when asking it to plan your day.
