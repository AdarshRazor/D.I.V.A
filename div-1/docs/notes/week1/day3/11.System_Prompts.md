# Day 3: System Prompts - The Ghost in the Machine

> **The 80/20 Takeaway:** The **System Prompt** is the "God Mode" instruction that the user never sees. It defines *who* the AI is. The **User Prompt** is just the current task. **Rule:** Spend 80% of your time refining the System Prompt; it fixes 80% of downstream errors.

## 1. The Core Mental Model: "The Method Actor"

*   **System Prompt:** The script and character background given to an actor *before* they walk on stage. ("You are a grumpy 19th-century lighthouse keeper.")
*   **User Prompt:** The audience shouting questions. ("What's the weather?")
*   **Result:** The actor answers *in character*. ("The gale blows hard from the North, ye landlubber!")

### Why it matters for D.I.V.A
If you don't set a System Prompt, the AI defaults to "Helpful Assistant."
*   **Without System Prompt:** "The weather is sunny."
*   **With D.I.V.A System Prompt:** "Sir, sensors indicate clear skies. Optimal for your morning run."

## 2. Anatomy of a Perfect System Prompt

Don't write a novel. Use this structure:

1.  **Role:** "You are D.I.V.A, an advanced AI orchestrator."
2.  **Mission:** "Your goal is to manage my digital life efficiently and concisely."
3.  **Tone/Style:** "Be professional, witty, and extremely brief. No fluff."
4.  **Constraints:** "Never apologize. Never say 'As an AI'. Output JSON when asked."

## 3. Advanced Technique: Dynamic System Prompts

You don't need *one* system prompt. You can swap them based on the task.
*   **The "Coder" Persona:** "You are a Senior Python Engineer. Strict typing. No comments."
*   **The "Writer" Persona:** "You are a Creative Copywriter. Use metaphors. Be emotional."

**For D.I.V.A:**
Your "Orchestrator" will detect the user's intent and *swap* the System Prompt before sending it to the LLM.
*   User: "Fix this bug." -> Load **Coder** Persona.
*   User: "Draft a tweet." -> Load **Writer** Persona.

## 4. Summary for D.I.V.A

*   **Hardcode the Soul:** Your `system_prompt.txt` is the most important file in your repo.
*   **Iterate:** You will tweak this file 100 times.
*   **Safety:** Use the System Prompt to stop it from doing dangerous things ("Do not delete files without confirmation").
