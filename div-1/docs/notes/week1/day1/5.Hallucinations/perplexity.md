The most important 20% of learnings about hallucinations—the core concepts that will help you understand 80% of the topic—are:


- Definition: Hallucinations are sensory experiences that occur without any external stimulus. They feel real to the person experiencing them, even though nothing is actually present in the environment[1][3][4][5][9].
- Types: Hallucinations can affect any of the five senses:

Auditory (hearing voices or sounds that aren’t there) — most common, especially in psychiatric conditions.
Visual (seeing things that don’t exist).
Tactile (feeling sensations, like bugs crawling on the skin, without a physical cause).
Olfactory (smelling odors that aren’t present).
Gustatory (tasting things that aren’t there)[1][3][4][5][7][9].

- Distinction from Related Phenomena:

Hallucinations are different from illusions (misinterpretations of real external stimuli) and pseudohallucinations (where the person recognizes the experience is not real)[1][5].

- Causes: Hallucinations can result from a wide range of factors, including:

Psychiatric disorders (especially schizophrenia, but also bipolar disorder, severe depression, and delirium).
Neurological conditions (such as epilepsy, brain lesions, or neurodegenerative diseases).
Substance use (including hallucinogenic drugs, alcohol withdrawal, or medication side effects).
Medical conditions (such as high fever, sleep deprivation, sensory deprivation, or severe illness)[1][3][4][6][7][8].

- Clinical Significance: Hallucinations are often a symptom of psychosis (a loss of contact with reality), but can also occur in non-psychotic states (e.g., sleep deprivation, fever)[1][4][7][8].
- Insight: Some people experiencing hallucinations recognize them as unreal (pseudohallucinations), while others are convinced of their reality, which is more typical in psychotic disorders[1][4][5].
- Impact: Hallucinations can cause significant distress, confusion, and functional impairment, especially when persistent or associated with other symptoms like delusions[3][4][7].
